From here, you can download VScode regardless of your operating system, as long as you select the appropriate option. Follow the installation process

**Remotely connecting**

Once VScode is opened, open the terminal by selecting the option or by using holding down CTRL on your keyboard and pressing the "`" key. The terminal should appear on the bottom half of VScode application. Then, type in "ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu" in the terminal, replacing the "zz" in the email with that which appears in your course-specific account. To find this account, go to https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php to find your account. After the 
command is typed in the terminal, click ENTER on your keyboard and you will be prompted with a password. Please type in your corresponding password
in the command line. (Note: for privacy protection, you will not be able to see your password as you are typing it).
