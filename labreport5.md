**Lab Report 5**

**1st Original student post**

I am on MacOs operating system, using VScode.

When trying to run the the checkstyle files to see if my PA was properly formatted using the guide assigned by Professor Cao, it returns a 
message stating that there are no files to process. I expect to see the checkstyle jar file going through each line of the MyMinHeap.java file 
and reporting any violations of the specific formatting but it does not report anything.


The failure-inducing input must be from the file name, as when I enter the checkstyle terminal command without any file name afterwards, it returns the following message:
```
Missing required parameter: '<files>'
Usage: checkstyle [OPTIONS]... FILES...
Try 'checkstyle --help' for more information.
```
I'm pretty sure my checkstyle syntax is right, and the working directory is also right because the terminal line says I am in starter, which is the file that 
MyMinHeap.java is located in.
