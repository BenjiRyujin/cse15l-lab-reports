**Lab Report 3**

**Grep command-line options**

**1) `-c`**

```
benjiryujin@MacBook-Pro-90 biomed % grep -c "average" 1471-2407-3-16.txt      
9
```

The `-c` grep option allows us to get a count of how many times a pattern appears in the specified file. In this case, we use the `-c` option in the "biomed" directory of "technical" to get the count of how many times the word "average" appears in the text file, which is 9.
